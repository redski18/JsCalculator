# JsCalculator
This is my attempt at making a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# How to Use
To use the calculator, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The calculator will load automatically in your browser window.

To perform a calculation, click the buttons on the calculator's interface. The buttons are labeled with the numbers 0-9, as well as the arithmetic operations +, -, *, and รท.

To clear the current calculation, click the "C" button. To clear the entire calculator, click the "AC" button.

# Files Included
The following files are included in this project:

- index.html: The main HTML file that displays the calculator interface.
- styles.css: The CSS file that styles the calculator interface.
- script.js: The JavaScript file that implements the calculator's functionality.

# Customization
This calculator is designed to be easy to customize. You can modify the appearance of the calculator by editing the CSS in style.css. You can also modify the calculator's functionality by editing the JavaScript in script.js.
